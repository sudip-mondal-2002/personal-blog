JavaScript is awesome for beginning programmers.
It's a great language because it's easy to learn, and once mastered it's an excellent tool for building almost any type of website or application.
Although JavaScript comes with several frameworks to help developers build applications, these frameworks often complicate things and make the code hard to read.

Javascript was created in 1993 by Brenden Eich. 
At that time the web `1. browser` was a cutting edge technology the connected the people through the world wide web via internet.
At the beginning, the websites were completely static, built with pure `2. HTML`. 
Javascript was built as an easy to use `3. High level language`. 
Today it's arguably the most popular language in the world. 
The standard implementation of JavaScript is called `4. EchmaScript` and it's the default language in every browser. 
In fact it's the only language that runs on a browser except `5. Web Assembly`. 
But it's not the only `6. Runtime` of JavaScript. It can also run on server via NodeJS, Deno etc. 

As the name suggests, it's a `7. Scripting Language`. 
That means you can execute code by opening the console in `8. Dev tools` on your browser. 
Unlike other languages such as C, it's `9. Interpreted` and not compiled. 
Although, interpreted is not the accurate term here.
In the browser there is a `10. JS Engine` called V8 that makes JS run extremely fast but taking your code and converting it to machine code by a process called `11. Just in Time Compilation`.

To use JavaScript in a web page, you'll first need a HTML document. Inside which there will be a `12. Script Tag`. 
You can code directly inside the script tag or refer any external JS file using the `13. 'src' Attribute`.
You can print hellow world using `14. console.log` which is the built in method for printing to stdout.

```html
<html>
  <srcipt>
    console.log("hello world!")
  </script>
</html>
```
  
```html
<html>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</html>
```

There are several different ways to define a variable in JavaScript. The most popular way today is `15. let`. It's a `16. dynamically-typed` language, so it's not neccessary to mention the type of a variable. The variables are commonly named in `17. camelCase`. Assigning a value isn't neccessary but possible.
There are seven `18. Premitive` data types. 
If we don't assign a value to a variable it automatically assigned to `19. undefined` type which is a premitive type in JS.
However we can explicitly represent an empty value using `20. null` and later on we can re-assign the same variable to a `21. string` or any other data type.
Any type that's not premitive will inherit from the `22. Object` class. We'll talk about it later.
```js
let myNumber; // undefined
myNumber = null; // null
myNumber = "eleven"; // string
myNumber = 11; // number
myNumber = new Object();
```
<img src="/assets/images/semicolon_meme.jpg" align="right" height="300px">

Here is the list of 7 premitive data types.
- string
- number
- bigint
- boolean
- undefined
- symbol
- null

In JavaScript, the `23. Semicolon;` is optional. The JavaScript compiler adds it automatically. In real life JS developers often fight over whether to keep the semicolon or not while coding their project.

However, `let` isn't the only way to define a variable. 
You can define a variable using `24. const` for those which variables can't be reassigned later. 
But the original way to declare a variable was using `25. var`. 
The only reason to have so many different ways to declare a variable is due to `26. Lexical environment` which actually defines where variables work and where they don't.
There is a `27. Global scope`. If we define a variable inside a `28. function`, it work in a `29. Local scope` inside the function. If we have a statement like if condition, variables can be scoped inside that and it's called a `30. Blocked scope` unless you define it using `var`. In the case of var it'll work in the function environment and this is a concept called `31. Hoisting`. 

```js
let myVar = "global"
function myFun(){
  let a = "local"
  if (true){
    let b = "blocked"
    var c = "hoisted 😵‍💫"
  }
}
```

When function keyword is used by itself it's called a `32. Function definition`. Functions are one of the building blocks in JS. They work by taking `33. Input params` or arguments and optionally `34. return` a value.
```js
function myFun(a,b){
  return a+b
}
myFun(2,3) // returns 5
```
However, functions are also objects and can be used as `35. Function expressions`. 
It allows us to use it as variables or to construuct `36. Higher order functions` where a function can be used as an arguement or a return value. 
```js
const fun = function(a,b){
  return a+b
} // Function expression

function higherOrder(f){
  f()
  return function(){
    console.log("done")
  }
}
```

Functions can also be nested inside other functions to create a `37. Closure` in order to encapsulate data and logic from the rest of the program.
When you create a premitive inside a function that is stored in the `38. Call stack` which is the browsers short term memory. 
However while creating a closure, the inner function can act as a variable even after the outer function completes its run.
That happens because in the case of a closure JS automatically stores the data in the `39. Heap` which will persist between function calls.
```js
function outer(a,b){
  function inner(x){ // closure
    return x+1
  }
  return inner(a) + inner(b)
}
```
Another interesting thing in JS is `40. this`. 
If it's accessed from the global scope it references to the `41 global window` in which it's running. 
However if it's accessed inside a function it'll refer to the object the function is assigned to. 
We can bind a function to a object using the `42. bind` function. 
```js
console.log(this) // global/window
const person = {
  fun: function(){
     return this // person object
  }
}
function wtfIsThis(){
  console.log(this)
}
wtfIsThis.bind(person)
```

This can be confusing and mordern JS comes with a new syntax of defining functions called `43. Arrow functions`. 
Arrow functions have their own `this` value which is `44. Annonymous`.
```js
const arrowFun = ()=>{
   console.log("Arrow function")
}
```

One thing to keep in mind, while passing an arguement, premitives are `45. Passed by value` which means a copy is created of the original variable.
But, if an object is passed as an arguement, then it's stored in the `Heap` and `46. Passed by reference`. 
A simple way to define an object is using the `47. Object literal` syntax or using the `48. Object constructor`.
```js
const obj1 = {} // object literal
const obj2 = new Object() // object constructor
```
An object is contained with key value pairs which are called `49. Properties`.
```js
const obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3() {
     return "value3"
  }
```
Objects can inherit properties from each other using `50. Prototype chain`. 
Every object has a private property that links to exactly one prototype. This differs javascript from a class based `51. inheritance` approach.
However, to add into confusion, JavaScript supports `52. OOP` with a `53. class` keyword.
A class can define a `54. constructor` which is called when the object is first created.
You can add properties and optionally add `55. Getters/Setters` to access them.
We can add `56. Instance methods` too which will be specific to the object or make them global to the class using `57. static method`.
```js
class Person{
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name
    this.totalSteps = 0
  }
  get gender(){
    return this.gender
  }
  set gender(val){
    this.gender = val
  }
  walk(steps){
    this.totalSteps += steps
  }
  static isHuman(){
    return true
  }
}
```

In addition to objects, JS also come up with some in built data structures like an `58. Array` holding a dynamic collection of indexed items or a `59. Set` which holds a collection of unique items.
JS also have a `60. Map` data structure which is a key value pair like an object but more easily looped over along with some other featres.
```js
const arr = ["zero", "one", "two"]
const unique = new Set([1,2,3])
const map = new Map([
  ["foo",1],
  ["bar",2]
])
```

Javascript is a `61. Garbage collected` language means it automatically removes object from memory when they are no longer referenced in your code. When you have a map all the properties are referenced. However there are `62. WeakMap and WeakSet` which have properties garbage collected to reduce memory usage.

JavaScript has an interesting feture called `63. Non-blocking event loop`. 
Normally when you write code in a script it executes `64. synchronously` which means the next line can't be executed before the previous line is completed execution. 
However it's possible to write `65. Asynchronous` code using event loops in JavaScript which runs in a seperate `66. Thread pool` while the rest of the application continues to execute without interruption. 
This is really important because mordern websites often have multiple things going on at the same time but they have access to only one thread for computing (`67. Single threaded`) called the main thread. Without asynchronous code it'll be impossible to multitask.
An easy way to demonstrate this is `68. setTimeOut` function which takes a `69. Callback` as an arguement. 
```js
setTimeOut(()=>{
  console.log("After 2 sec")
},2000)
```
When Callbacks become too nested, we call it a `70. Callback Hell`. 
But we have better ways to write Async codes like `71. Promise` whose value is unknown right now but it'll `72. Resolve` to a value in the future like calling a 3rd party API and getting the value.
If something goes wrong, the promise can `73. Reject` to raise an error.
```js
const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve, reject)=>{
     // Write code here
    if(success){
      resolve("success")
    } else {
      reject("failure")
    }
  }
)
```
The consumer of the promise can use methods like `74. then/catch` to handle the possible outcomes.
```
promise.then(success=>console.log).catch(failure=>console.log)
```

A better way is to use an `75. async function` that directly return a promise. 
In the body of the function we can process the execution of using the `76. await` keyword.
However for exception handling, it's needed to wrap the await statement inside a `77. try/catch` block.
```js
async function fun(){
  try{
    const success = await promise
  } catch(error) {
  
  } 
}
```

As your code grows in complexity, it's better to use seperate files. 
Luckily we can share code between files using `78. ES Modules`.
If we want to export something, let's say a function, we use `79. Default export` before importing it to another file.
We can also export multiple things at once from a file using a feature called `80. Named export`.
```js
// myFile.js
export default fun(){
  console.log("having fun")
}

---
// In other file
import fun from "myFile.js"
fun()
```
